title: "A simple rstudio addin for current issues with project"
output: github_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a small project to create an addin for your r-projects that you place on github.
To direct your workflow you often open issues and solve them with pull requests. 

So 

- see open issues on current project (gh name and gh current repo, get the issues)
- open new issues from rstudio
- perhaps paste the issue number and or link in git commit message?
